# SHIDO-Framework
The SHIDO project is dedicated to implement **shell** (terminal) on Arduino as well as a control environment capable of automated tasks offering a dynamic way to control Arduinos with a code that does not need to flashed each time or changing it.

## Features
The SHIDO project offers the ability to access arduino via a shell that is implemented using UART protocol. As well as offering a network of **controller-target** (master-slave) of arduinos that give an arduino master the ability to controll and send commands to multiple slaves of arduinos.

## Development Process
This project was developped using arduino IDE for coding and proteus for testing.

## DEMO
A demonstration using proteus software.
